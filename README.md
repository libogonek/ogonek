# Ogonek

Ogonek is mostly the result of me playing around with Unicode. Currently the
library is still in alpha stages, so I don't recommend using it for anything
serious, mainly because not all APIs are stabilised. You are welcome to play
around with it for any non-serious purposes, though.

## Helping out

Any feedback is appreciated. I am still designing and fleshing out some parts of
the APIs, so I appreciate any [bug reports][issue tracker] or design suggestions.

I often discuss my design in the [C++ Lounge][lounge] on Stack Overflow. Feel
free to join me there.

I am currently in the process of cleaning up some things after a long hiatus
before I can get back to serious development.

Pull requests are welcome too! There is a list of tasks I want done for 1.0.0 in
the [issue tracker]. Feel free to pick one to tackle!
